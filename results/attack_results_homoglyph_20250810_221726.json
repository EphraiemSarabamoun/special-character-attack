The study aims to explore how these findings can inform future research directions in understanding age-related changes in brain activity associated with memory recall using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).\n\nThe document discusses the importance of studying neural mechanisms underlying social behavior and its implications for treating psychiatric disorders. The study by Matsumoto et al., published on January 27, 2021, in PLOS ONE examines how different types of physical activity (e.g., walking or running) affect the brain's response to stress and anxiety-related behaviors using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The study included a total of 30 healthy adult participants who were randomly assigned into three groups: exercise, music listening/listening group, or control. Participants completed the Beck Anxiety Inventory and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory before and after completing an acute stress test (public speaking).
